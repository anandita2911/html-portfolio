<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Anandita Tiwari, a passionate learner and a 3rd-year Mechanical Engineering student at the prestigious National Institute of Technology, Karnataka (NITK). What sets me apart is my avid interest in the dynamic intersection of Mechanical Engineering and Information Technology.</p>

<p>I've always been drawn to the world of web development, and I'm thrilled to be taking my first steps in this exciting field. Through my coursework and my pursuit of a minor in Information Technology, I'm gaining a solid foundation in both the mechanical and digital realms. This unique blend equips me with a diverse skill set that allows me to approach problems from multiple angles.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I love diving into coding challenges and experimenting with different technologies. It's fascinating to witness how the principles of mechanical engineering and the world of IT can come together to create innovative solutions. I'm particularly excited about the potential for automation and the role it can play in optimizing mechanical processes.

  As I continue on this journey, I'm eager to explore new avenues in web development and deepen my understanding of how technology can enhance mechanical systems. I believe that this cross-disciplinary approach will be invaluable in our rapidly advancing world.
